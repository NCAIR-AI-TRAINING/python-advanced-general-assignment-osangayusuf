# Python Visitor Logging Assignment

## Overview
You will build a Python program that logs visitors into a file while enforcing:
- No duplicate consecutive visitors
- A mandatory 5‑minute wait between different visitors

This repo contains:
- `main.py` → Scaffold you must complete
- Tests → Used for automatic grading
- GitHub Actions → Runs your tests on every push

# 📌 Part 2 — Branching Requirement

You **must** use at least 2 branches.

### Step 1 — Work on the main branch
Implement duplicate‑visitor logic.

```
git add .
git commit -m "duplicate visitor done"
git push
```

### Step 2 — Create a new branch for the 5‑minute rule

```
git checkout -b feature/wait-time
```

Implement the 5‑minute rule.

```
git add .
git commit -m "added 5 minute waiting rule"
git push --set-upstream origin feature/wait-time
```

### Step 3 — Create a Pull Request
On GitHub:
1. Go to your repo
2. Click **Pull Requests**
3. Click **New Pull Request**
4. Compare `feature/wait-time` → `main`
5. Submit PR

### Step 4 — Merge the PR
Click **Merge Pull Request**.
